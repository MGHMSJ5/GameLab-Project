Good morning Natasha, have you arrived at the park yet? #speaker:Lars #portrait:Lars #layout:left
You know your tasks, right?
Today is your turn of spotting animals and plants for the sexennial inventory.
So, take a walk through the park and note down the species that you find.
Do have any questions about that?

Hey Lars! No questions needed. I got it! #speaker:Natasha #portrait:Natasha #layout:right

Alright, have fun Nat! #speaker:Lars #portrait:Lars #layout:left
